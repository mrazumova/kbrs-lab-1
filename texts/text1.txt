maycomb was an old town, but it was a tired old town when i first knew it. in rainy weather the streets turned to red slop; grass grew on the sidewalks, the courthouse sagged in the square. somehow, it was hotter then: a black dog suffered on a summer’s day; bony mules hitched to hoover carts flicked flies in the sweltering shade of the live oaks on the square. men’s stiff collars wilted by nine in the morning. ladies bathed before noon, after their three-o’clock naps, and by nightfall were like soft teacakes with frostings of sweat and sweet talcum.

people moved slowly then. they ambled across the square, shuffled in and out of the stores around it, took their time about everything. a day was twenty-four hours long but seemed longer. there was no hurry, for there was nowhere to go, nothing to buy and no money to buy it with, nothing to see outside the boundaries of maycomb county. but it was a time of vague optimism for some of the people: maycomb county had recently been told that it had nothing to fear but fear itself.

we lived on the main residential street in town—atticus, jem and i, plus calpurnia our cook. jem and i found our father satisfactory: he played with us, read to us, and treated us with courteous detachment.
