miss caroline began the day by reading us a story about cats. the cats had long conversations with one another, they wore cunning little clothes and lived in a warm house beneath a kitchen stove. by the time mrs. cat called the drugstore for an order of chocolate malted mice the class was wriggling like a bucketful of catawba worms. miss caroline seemed unaware that the ragged, denim-shirted and floursack-skirted first grade, most of whom had chopped cotton and fed hogs from the time they were able to walk, were immune to imaginative literature. miss caroline came to the end of the story and said, “oh, my, wasn’t that nice?”

then she went to the blackboard and printed the alphabet in enormous square capitals, turned to the class and asked, “does anybody know what these are?”

everybody did; most of the first grade had failed it last year.

i suppose she chose me because she knew my name; as i read the alphabet a faint line appeared between her eyebrows, and after making me read most of my first reader and the stock-market quotations from the mobile register aloud, she discovered that i was literate and looked at me with more than faint distaste. miss caroline told me to tell my father not to teach me any more, it would interfere with my reading.

“teach me?” i said in surprise. “he hasn’t taught me anything, miss caroline. atticus ain’t got time to teach me anything,” i added, when miss caroline smiled and shook her head. “why, he’s so tired at night he just sits in the livingroom and reads.”

“if he didn’t teach you, who did?” miss caroline asked good-naturedly. “somebody did. you weren’t born reading the mobile register.”

“jem says i was. he read in a book where i was a bullfinch instead of a finch. jem says my name’s really jean louise bullfinch, that i got swapped when i was born and i’m really a—”



miss caroline apparently thought i was lying. “let’s not let our imaginations run away with us, dear,” she said. “now you tell your father not to teach you any more. it’s best to begin reading with a fresh mind. you tell him i’ll take over from here and try to undo the damage—”

“ma’am?”

“your father does not know how to teach. you can have a seat now.”

i mumbled that i was sorry and retired meditating upon my crime. i never deliberately learned to read, but somehow i had been wallowing illicitly in the daily papers. in the long hours of church—was it then i learned? i could not remember not being able to read hymns. now that i was compelled to think about it, reading was something that just came to me, as learning to fasten the seat of my union suit without looking around, or achieving two bows from a snarl of shoelaces. i could not remember when the lines above atticus’s moving finger separated into words, but i had stared at them all the evenings in my memory, listening to the news of the day, bills to be enacted into laws, the diaries of lorenzo dow—anything atticus happened to be reading when i crawled into his lap every night. until i feared i would lose it, i never loved to read. one does not love breathing.

i knew i had annoyed miss caroline, so i let well enough alone and stared out the window until recess when jem cut me from the covey of first-graders in the schoolyard. he asked how i was getting along. i told him.

“if i didn’t have to stay i’d leave. jem, that damn lady says atticus’s been teaching me to read and for him to stop it—”

“don’t worry, scout,” jem confronted me. “our teacher says miss caroline’s introducing a new way of teaching. she learned about it in college. it’ll be in all the grades soon. you don’t have to learn much out of books that way—it’s like if you wanta learn about cows, you go milk one, see?”

“yeah jem, but i don’t wanta study cows, i—”

“sure you do. you hafta know about cows, they’re a big part of life in maycomb county.”

i contented myself with asking jem if he’d lost his mind.

“i’m just trying to tell you the new way they’re teachin’ the first grade, stubborn. it’s the dewey decimal system.”

having never questioned jem’s pronouncements, i saw no reason to begin now. the dewey decimal system consisted, in part, of miss caroline waving cards at us on which were printed “the,” “cat,” “rat,” “man,” and “you.” no comment seemed to be expected of us, and the class received these impressionistic revelations in silence. i was bored, so i began a letter to dill. miss caroline caught me writing and told me to tell my father to stop teaching me. “besides,” she said. “we don’t write in the first grade, we print. you won’t learn to write until you’re in the third grade.”
